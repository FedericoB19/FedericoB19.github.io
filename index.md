### CPSC 120

*Lab 1
    I think lab 1 has to be one of the ones everyone enjoyed because I did. 
    It was the first class meeting and first lab. As well as we were introduced 
    to our partners for the first 2 labs. 

*Lab 3
    Lab 3 was enjoyable but what I think made it more fun was the partner I had.
    great partner as well as a great computer science major, the experience during lab 
    3 I think it was the best one because of the partner I had. 

*Lab 7
    Again the big part that made lab 7 a great lab was while me and my partner were working 
    and got down to the last minutes of the lab class time, we complete the lab close to the end 
    but where not passing the lint test but with a couple of tweaks we were able to pass the lint
    test all in one lab which made it exciting.
